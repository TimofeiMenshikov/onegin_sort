And lose the name of action. â€“ Soft you now!
And enterprises of great pith and moment
Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought,
To be, or not to be: that is the question:
Must give us pause: there's the respect
Devoutly to be wish'd. To die, to sleep;
The oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely,
With a bare bodkin? who would fardels bear,
Or to take arms against a sea of troubles,
The fair Ophelia! Nymph, in thy orisons
The pangs of despised love, the law's delay,
With this regard their currents turn awry,
And by opposing end them? To die: to sleep;
The undiscover'd country from whose bourn
The heart-ache and the thousand natural shocks
Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer
That patient merit of the unworthy takes,
The insolence of office and the spurns
And thus the native hue of resolution
That flesh is heir to, 'tis a consummation
For who would bear the whips and scorns of time,
For in that sleep of death what dreams may come
No traveller returns, puzzles the will
Thus conscience does make cowards of us all;
And makes us rather bear those ills we have
The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,
When we have shuffled off this mortal coil,
That makes calamity of so long life;
Than fly to others that we know not of?
When he himself might his quietus make
No more; and by a sleep to say we end
To grunt and sweat under a weary life,
To sleep: perchance to dream: ay, there's the rub;
But that the dread of something after death,
Be all my sins remember'd.
